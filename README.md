# Social Growth Automation (n8n Workflows)

This repository is dedicated to **growing on social media with automation** — practical n8n workflows you can import and run in minutes.

## What you’ll find here
A collection of **ready-to-use n8n workflows** focused on:
- content distribution & scheduling
- repurposing posts across platforms
- engagement & community ops
- tracking performance and iterating faster

## First drop: “Post on X”
The first workflow shared here is **Post on X** — a simple automation to publish content on X (Twitter) from n8n.
- Google sheet will come soon

### Notes
- **Credentials are not included.** You’ll need to create your own credentials inside n8n.
- Check the workflow nodes for any required **environment variables / placeholders** (API keys, tokens, webhooks, etc.).
- Releases are versioned (v1.0.0, v1.1.0…) so you can always download the latest stable file.

## How to import
- Download the workflow JSON from **GitHub Releases**
- In n8n: **Workflows → Import**
- Open the imported workflow and configure your credentials
