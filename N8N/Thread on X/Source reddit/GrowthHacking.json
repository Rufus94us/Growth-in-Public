Got exactly 4 backlinks from 200+ hours of work. Finally realized most YouTube strategies are designed for content about the strategies, not for actually building links at scale.\n\nwe launched a B2B SaaS and needed backlinks to move DA from 0 to something respectable. Watched dozens of videos promising \"easy backlinks\" and \"proven strategies.\" Each technique sounded logical in the video but completely fell apart in execution.\n\nBroken link building consumed 40+ hours. Found 60 dead links on relevant sites using tools, crafted personalized emails offering my content as replacement. Response rate: 3%. Links gained: 1. The problem nobody mentions in videos is most sites don't care about fixing broken links and the ones that do get 50 similar emails daily.\n\nSkyscraper technique took 35 hours. Found top-ranking content in my niche, created \"10x better\" versions with more data and examples, reached out to sites linking to competitors. Response rate: 1.2%. Links gained: 0. Turns out sites link to established domains they trust, not random new sites with \"better content.\"\n\nResource page outreach was another 30 hours. Searched for \"keyword + resources\" and \"keyword + links\" finding 80 potential pages. Personalized emails requesting inclusion. Response rate: 4%. Links gained: 2. Most resource pages are abandoned or the owner wants $200-500 for \"premium placement.\"\n\nHARO consumed 25 hours monitoring queries and crafting expert responses. Submitted 40 relevant responses over two months. Featured: 3 times. Links gained: 1 (two were nofollow). The ratio of effort to output made it unsustainable for a founder juggling product work.\n\nWhat actually worked was admitting these \"strategies\" are time sinks for new domains. Used [directory submission service](http://getmorebacklinks.org/) getting listed on 200+ directories in one batch. Over 90 days, 48 links indexed moving DA from 0 to 18. Time invested: 30 minutes filling one form.\n\nCombined directories with simple tactics that scale: consistent content publishing (2 posts weekly) earning 6 natural links over 4 months, commenting on industry blogs with real insights (not spam) leading to 3 relationship-based links, and building actual product features competitors lacked getting mentioned in 4 comparison posts.\n\nAfter 5 months of realistic tactics: DA 21, 42 total referring domains, 890 monthly organic visitors. Not explosive but sustainable without burning 200 hours on techniques with 1-2% success rates. Tbh YouTube strategies work for established sites with existing authority. For new domains they're massive time sinks. Start with scalable foundation tactics like directories, then layer relationship-based links as you grow, not the reverse.",

          "selftext": "I have been on both sides of the table. I built two companies as a founder, had three exits in total, and now I spend my days building new ventures with entrepreneurs.\n\nThe biggest red flag I see right now is founders still planning for 2015-era marketing. They want to hire a creative writer or a brand expert. If you are building for 2026, you need to stop treating marketing as a creative department and start treating it as an engineering problem.\n\nThe founders winning today aren't asking \"How can AI write this post?\". They are asking \"How can AI build a distribution machine?\".\n\nHere are 10 engineering mechanisms we are implementing. These aren't theories, they are systems you can build today.\n\n1. The Infinite Creative Loop Stop paying designers to make one banner. We build agents that generate hundreds of variations of hooks and visuals. The system watches the data. If Variation A works, it breeds variations A1 and A2 automatically. It is evolutionary biology applied to ads. (Tools: Midjourney API + Phyton scripts for ad injection)\n\n2. Adaptive Budget Allocation Humans are too slow to manage budgets across 50 campaigns. We let scripts monitor the CPA via API. If a campaign hits the target, the money moves there instantly. It allows small teams to run high volume experiments without burning cash.\n\n3. Signal Hunting for LTV Don't just stare at Excel. We let LLMs run on raw user data to find weird correlations humans miss. For example, finding that users who saw a specific \"Social Proof\" screen during the quiz converted 3x better to paid plans weeks later.\n\n4. Contextual Data Layer We are moving away from static dashboards like Tableau. The new standard is a data layer that AI agents can query and \"talk\" to directly to get answers regarding CAC, LTV and attribution.\n\n5. From SEO to AEO (Answer Engine Optimization) Search is moving from Google links to ChatGPT answers. The new strategy isn't keywords, it is \"Community Authority.\" We analyze where our audience hangs out (like specific subreddits or forums) and create high-value content hubs that LLMs will cite as sources. We don't spam; we become the reference. (Strategy: Targeting \" Reddit/Quora Discussions\" that rank on Google)\n\n6. Dynamic Real-Time Quizzes Static forms kill conversion. A modern onboarding quiz generates questions dynamically based on the previous answer. If the tech detects urgency, the next question digs into that specific pain point immediately. (Tools: Typeform Logic / Custom React Flows)\n\n7. Behavioral Activation Most churn happens because users don't find value fast enough. Instead of generic email flows, intelligent systems detect \"stuck moments\" in the UI and trigger a specific message or video to unblock that specific user right then and there.\n\n8. Programmatic Personal Video Video converts better than text, but you can't record a thousand videos. We use tools to record once and let the software change the lipsync and audio to say the specific lead's name and company. (Tools: HeyGen / Tavus)\n\n9. Competitor Weakness Mining Instead of guessing what to write, we scrape competitors' 1-star reviews. The system clusters the complaints and auto-generates landing pages specifically addressing those pain points. (Tools: Apify for scraping + GPT-4o for clustering)\n\n10. Active Churn Prevention We connect an LLM to the support ticket stream. The system detects \"Anger\" sentiment before a human agent even opens the ticket and drafts a de-escalation response or suggests a compensation offer automatically.\n\nThe Takeaway The advantage in 2026 won't be who has the best slogan. It will be who adopts engineering into their growth stack the fastest.\n\nI shared my stack, but I\u2019m sure I missed some good ones.

          "selftext": "TLDR: I ran quick, no-cost social media based advertising campaigns for my fiction novel which resulted in a bump in sales and an increased social media follower count. I was unable to increase review totals.\n\nHey all! So I ran my own small experiment in the month of December. With a $0 budget, I set out to market my Self-Published book. I've seen ebooks/ self publishing talked about here, so I figured it was fitting. These strategies could also probably be tweaked for other endeavors. I spent ONLY 15 to 20 minutes a day running small totally free advertising campaigns online. Here are my exact strategies and results. \n\nQUICK BACKGROUND  \n In 2011 I published my first book. It sold consistently 2 to 3 copies a month for the first decade. And from January 2025 to November 2025 it sold 3 copies total. I live in Alaska and the book is based in Alaska (relevent to my marketing). It's a 260 page winter-themed fantasy/ paranormal YA novel with 4.5 star review ratings on Goodreads and Amazon's. There are around 25 reviews on each site. It had a Facebook page following of 27 people and an Instagram page following of 780 people on December 1st 2025. \n\nBEGINNING STATS:  \nAverage Monthly Sale: 0.25 copies  \nInstagram Following: 780  \nFacebook Following: 27  \nTiktok Following: 0  \nReview Rating: 4.5 stars  \nGoodreads Reviews: 26  \nAmazon Reviews: 25  \n\nDAILY STRATEGIES  \nDay One: Liked comments by people reading similar genre books on Goodreads/ Library Facebook posts using my book's Facebook page account.  \nDay Two: Liked comments on Kindle and Goodreads posts on Facebook using my book's Facebook page account.  \nDay Three: Posted on Facebook for sale groups local to Alaska/ Liked local Alaskan handcrafters posts using my book's Facebook page account.  \nDay Four: Joined Facebook book recommendation groups. Liked posts similar to my book using my book's Facebook page account.  \nDay Five: Liked book recommendation comments on Facebook posts in book groups using my book's Facebook page account.  \nDay Six: Created a post about Arctic Animal folklore- shared it in mythology, book club, and Alaska groups on Facebook using my book's Facebook page account.  \nDay Seven: Posted an arctic animal folklore meme referencing my book on different reddits that made sense for the \"vibe\" of the meme.  \nDay Eight: Ran free kindle book campaign for 5 days/ advertised on Facebook free books page/ free reddits.  \nDay Nine: Followed Bookstagram accounts with my book's Instagram page.  \nDay Ten: Followed bookstagram accounts/ viewed stories/ liked posts with my book's Instagram page.  \nDay Eleven: Followed people who follow Alaskan book stores on Instagram with my book's Instagram page.  \nDay Twelve: Followed Alaska businesses on Facebook using my book's Facebook page account.  \nDay Thirteen: Posted in Facebook groups asking for bookstagram links, then followed those accounts with my book's Instagram page.  \nDay Fourteen: Created Tiktok account for my book and followed Booktok accounts.   \nDay Fifteen: Created 3 tiktoks for my book and used popular book tags.  \nDay Sixteen: Followed audio book reviewers on Instagram with my book's Instagram account. (I have an audio version).  \nDay Seventeen: Made genuine comments on Bookstagram accounts using my book's account (not about my book).  \nDay Eighteen: Followed Booktok accounts with my book's tiktok account.  \nDay Nineteen: Followed Alaskan tiktok accounts with my book's tiktok account.  \nDay Twenty: Made a tiktok about the sales of my book being very low from January to November, then getting a small bump in December. Thanked my followers. Also posted as a reel on Instagram and Facebook.   \nDay Twenty One: Commented on Booktok pages with my book's tiktok account interacting genuinely with their content.  \nDay Twenty Two: Liked Alaska library social media pages with my book's Facebook and Instagram account.  \nDay Twenty Three: Followed fantasy bookstagramers with my book's Instagram account.   \nDay Twenty Four: Followed paranormal bookstagramers with my book's Instagram account.  \nDay Twenty Five: Posted all my booktok videos as reels on Instagram using popular bookstagram tags.   \nDay Twenty Six: Followed YA bookstagramers on Instagram with my book's account.   \nDay Twenty Seven: Posted the first page of my book as a meme/ reel/ tiktok asking if it would persuade people to buy my book.  \nDay Twenty Eight: Viewed as many bookstagram reels with under 100 views, then liked them with my book's account.  \nDay Twenty Nine: Created a meme about feeling cozy reading in the winter (did not directly mention my book). Used my book's Facebook account to share the meme to multiple book club/ book lover groups.  \nDay Thirty: Liked bookstagram and booktok accounts with my book's page.  \n\nENDING STATS:  \nDecember Monthly Sale Total: 58 copies   \nBooks \"Sold\" During the Free Campaign (no royalties earned): 31  \nInstagram Following: 1281  \nFacebook Following: 108  \nTiktok Following: 74  \nReview Rating: 4.5 stars  \nGoodreads Reviews: 26  \nAmazon Reviews: 25  \n\nOverall, I was able to increase sales with this technique. I made royalties on 27 copies of my book and \"sold\" 58- which is vastly more than I've sold in one month in the last decade of sales. I was able to grow my follower counts fairly easily across Facebook, Instagram, and Tiktok. My biggest sales days were the first 3 \"free\" days (where my Kindle book was $0.00) with an average of 10 sales a day. My best non-free days of sales were:  \nDay Seventeen (made genuine comments on Bookstagram posts): 5 sales  \nDay Twenty-Seven (posted first page of book): 3 sales  \nDay Twenty (made post about small increase in sales in December thanking followers): 2 sales  \n\nAdditional factors: It was the Christmas selling season- this definitely may have helped. My book is also winter themed, which aids with seasonal sales.",

Here are my exact strategies and results. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;QUICK BACKGROUND&lt;br/&gt;\n In 2011 I published my first book. It sold consistently 2 to 3 copies a month for the first decade. And from January 2025 to November 2025 it sold 3 copies total. I live in Alaska and the book is based in Alaska (relevent to my marketing). It&amp;#39;s a 260 page winter-themed fantasy/ paranormal YA novel with 4.5 star review ratings on Goodreads and Amazon&amp;#39;s. There are around 25 reviews on each site. It had a Facebook page following of 27 people and an Instagram page following of 780 people on December 1st 2025. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;BEGINNING STATS:&lt;br/&gt;\nAverage Monthly Sale: 0.25 copies&lt;br/&gt;\nInstagram Following: 780&lt;br/&gt;\nFacebook Following: 27&lt;br/&gt;\nTiktok Following: 0&lt;br/&gt;\nReview Rating: 4.5 stars&lt;br/&gt;\nGoodreads Reviews: 26&lt;br/&gt;\nAmazon Reviews: 25  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;DAILY STRATEGIES&lt;br/&gt;\nDay One: Liked comments by people reading similar genre books on Goodreads/ Library Facebook posts using my book&amp;#39;s Facebook page account.&lt;br/&gt;\nDay Two: Liked comments on Kindle and Goodreads posts on Facebook using my book&amp;#39;s Facebook page account.&lt;br/&gt;\nDay Three: Posted on Facebook for sale groups local to Alaska/ Liked local Alaskan handcrafters posts using my book&amp;#39;s Facebook page account.&lt;br/&gt;\nDay Four: Joined Facebook book recommendation groups. Liked posts similar to my book using my book&amp;#39;s Facebook page account.&lt;br/&gt;\nDay Five: Liked book recommendation comments on Facebook posts in book groups using my book&amp;#39;s Facebook page account.&lt;br/&gt;\nDay Six: Created a post about Arctic Animal folklore- shared it in mythology, book club, and Alaska groups on Facebook using my book&amp;#39;s Facebook page account.&lt;br/&gt;\nDay Seven: Posted an arctic animal folklore meme referencing my book on different reddits that made sense for the &amp;quot;vibe&amp;quot; of the meme.&lt;br/&gt;\nDay Eight: Ran free kindle book campaign for 5 days/ advertised on Facebook free books page/ free reddits.&lt;br/&gt;\nDay Nine: Followed Bookstagram accounts with my book&amp;#39;s Instagram page.&lt;br/&gt;\nDay Ten: Followed bookstagram accounts/ viewed stories/ liked posts with my book&amp;#39;s Instagram page.&lt;br/&gt;\nDay Eleven: Followed people who follow Alaskan book stores on Instagram with my book&amp;#39;s Instagram page.&lt;br/&gt;\nDay Twelve: Followed Alaska businesses on Facebook using my book&amp;#39;s Facebook page account.&lt;br/&gt;\nDay Thirteen: Posted in Facebook groups asking for bookstagram links, then followed those accounts with my book&amp;#39;s Instagram page.&lt;br/&gt;\nDay Fourteen: Created Tiktok account for my book and followed Booktok accounts.&lt;br/&gt;\nDay Fifteen: Created 3 tiktoks for my book and used popular book tags.&lt;br/&gt;\nDay Sixteen: Followed audio book reviewers on Instagram with my book&amp;#39;s Instagram account. (I have an audio version).&lt;br/&gt;\nDay Seventeen: Made genuine comments on Bookstagram accounts using my book&amp;#39;s account (not about my book).&lt;br/&gt;\nDay Eighteen: Followed Booktok accounts with my book&amp;#39;s tiktok account.&lt;br/&gt;\nDay Nineteen: Followed Alaskan tiktok accounts with my book&amp;#39;s tiktok account.&lt;br/&gt;\nDay Twenty: Made a tiktok about the sales of my book being very low from January to November, then getting a small bump in December. Thanked my followers. Also posted as a reel on Instagram and Facebook.&lt;br/&gt;\nDay Twenty One: Commented on Booktok pages with my book&amp;#39;s tiktok account interacting genuinely with their content.&lt;br/&gt;\nDay Twenty Two: Liked Alaska library social media pages with my book&amp;#39;s Facebook and Instagram account.&lt;br/&gt;\nDay Twenty Three: Followed fantasy bookstagramers with my book&amp;#39;s Instagram account.&lt;br/&gt;\nDay Twenty Four: Followed paranormal bookstagramers with my book&amp;#39;s Instagram account.&lt;br/&gt;\nDay Twenty Five: Posted all my booktok videos as reels on Instagram using popular bookstagram tags.&lt;br/&gt;\nDay Twenty Six: Followed YA bookstagramers on Instagram with my book&amp;#39;s account.&lt;br/&gt;\nDay Twenty Seven: Posted the first page of my book as a meme/ reel/ tiktok asking if it would persuade people to buy my book.&lt;br/&gt;\nDay Twenty Eight: Viewed as many bookstagram reels with under 100 views, then liked them with my book&amp;#39;s account.&lt;br/&gt;\nDay Twenty Nine: Created a meme about feeling cozy reading in the winter (did not directly mention my book). Used my book&amp;#39;s Facebook account to share the meme to multiple book club/ book lover groups.&lt;br/&gt;\nDay Thirty: Liked bookstagram and booktok accounts with my book&amp;#39;s page.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;ENDING STATS:&lt;br/&gt;\nDecember Monthly Sale Total: 58 copies&lt;br/&gt;\nBooks &amp;quot;Sold&amp;quot; During the Free Campaign (no royalties earned): 31&lt;br/&gt;\nInstagram Following: 1281&lt;br/&gt;\nFacebook Following: 108&lt;br/&gt;\nTiktok Following: 74&lt;br/&gt;\nReview Rating: 4.5 stars&lt;br/&gt;\nGoodreads Reviews: 26&lt;br/&gt;\nAmazon Reviews: 25  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Overall, I was able to increase sales with this technique. I made royalties on 27 copies of my book and &amp;quot;sold&amp;quot; 58- which is vastly more than I&amp;#39;ve sold in one month in the last decade of sales. I was able to grow my follower counts fairly easily across Facebook, Instagram, and Tiktok. My biggest sales days were the first 3 &amp;quot;free&amp;quot; days (where my Kindle book was $0.00) with an average of 10 sales a day. My best non-free days of sales were:&lt;br/&gt;\nDay Seventeen (made genuine comments on Bookstagram posts): 5 sales&lt;br/&gt;\nDay Twenty-Seven (posted first page of book): 3 sales&lt;br/&gt;\nDay Twenty (made post about small increase in sales in December thanking followers): 2 sales  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Additional factors: It was the Christmas selling season- this definitely may have helped. My book is also winter themed, which aids with seasonal sales.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

How do you get your first 5 to 10 users without feeling like you\u2019re shouting into the void?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In my head, I always believed that if I could get the first 10 users I would say I just made it, and also getting or scaling that to 100 or 1,000 would be much easier. Now I\u2019m realizing the first 10 might be the hardest part. I know I can build the product, but getting those first users is a lot harder than I expected.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks in advance.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

These are classic ad metrics.  \n  \nThat's why they think it's failing.  \n  \nOn Reddit, however, real influence builds quietly, long before someone clicks your link.  \n  \nA user reads your helpful comment and upvotes it.  \n  \nCurious, they visit your profile, scroll through your post history.  \n  \nWeeks later, they slide into your DMs with a serious inquiry.  \n  \nNone of this shows up in your standard marketing funnel.  \n  \nIt looks like zero ROI... but it's actually the start of something powerful.  \n  \nSo I shared a different set of indicators with him:  \n  \nKarma growth in target subreddits  \nAverage upvotes per comment  \nViews per post  \n  \nThese aren't flashy, but they reveal the full journey.  \n  \nThe same conversation 2 weeks later sounded like:  \n  \n\"They thought Reddit was converting at just 3%,\" they admit.  \n  \n\"Once they tracked the community signals? It's closer to 18%.\"  \n  \nMost analytics platforms are built for paid ads, not organic communities.  \n  \nIf you're judging Reddit solely by clicks and immediate conversions, you're missing the magic.  \n  \nShift your lens to these deeper signals and watch hidden growth emerge.  \n  \nWhat metrics are you using for your community efforts?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/co8z9o37lhbg1.jpg?width=784&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fffec1453583f51ffb096dbc7a9d8e08578b226f\n\n",

These are classic ad metrics.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s why they think it&amp;#39;s failing.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On Reddit, however, real influence builds quietly, long before someone clicks your link.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A user reads your helpful comment and upvotes it.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Curious, they visit your profile, scroll through your post history.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Weeks later, they slide into your DMs with a serious inquiry.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;None of this shows up in your standard marketing funnel.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It looks like zero ROI... but it&amp;#39;s actually the start of something powerful.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I shared a different set of indicators with him:  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Karma growth in target subreddits&lt;br/&gt;\nAverage upvotes per comment&lt;br/&gt;\nViews per post  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These aren&amp;#39;t flashy, but they reveal the full journey.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The same conversation 2 weeks later sounded like:  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;They thought Reddit was converting at just 3%,&amp;quot; they admit.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Once they tracked the community signals? It&amp;#39;s closer to 18%.&amp;quot;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Most analytics platforms are built for paid ads, not organic communities.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re judging Reddit solely by clicks and immediate conversions, you&amp;#39;re missing the magic.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Shift your lens to these deeper signals and watch hidden growth emerge.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What metrics are you using for your community efforts?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/co8z9o37lhbg1.jpg?width=784&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=fffec1453583f51ffb096dbc7a9d8e08578b226f\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/co8z9o37lhbg1.jpg?width=784&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=fffec1453583f51ffb096dbc7a9d8e08578b226f&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Optimized landing page copy 12 different times, A/B tested headlines, changed CTA button colors, tried exit-intent popups, built email nurture sequences, analyzed every funnel metric in Mixpanel. Signup conversion went from 2.1% to 2.8% which felt like progress. But monthly revenue stayed stuck around $800-900 the entire time.\n\nThe real problem was I was optimizing people into a mediocre product. Spent all my time on acquisition tactics but ignored that 60% of signups never came back after day 1 and 80% churned within 30 days. I kept thinking I just needed more top-of-funnel traffic to make up for the leaks. Classic growth hacker mentality, optimize inputs without fixing the core experience. Everything changed in July when I finally stopped tweaking funnels and just started talking to the people who signed up then disappeared. Reached out to 30 churned users asking what happened. Responses were brutally honest, onboarding was confusing, core feature didn't work like they expected, couldn't figure out how to do what they signed up for, gave up after 10 minutes. Nobody mentioned my landing page copy or button colors.\n\nSpent August completely rebuilding onboarding based on those conversations. Made the first-run experience way simpler, added contextual tooltips explaining what everything does, created a 2-minute video showing the basic workflow. Didn't touch my landing page or funnels at all. Just fixed the experience after signup.\n\nSeptember my day-1 retention went from 40% to 71%. 30-day retention jumped from 20% to 52%. Revenue grew from $900 to $1,600 with the exact same traffic and signup conversion. October hit $2,400, November reached $3,600. Same number of signups each month but way more sticking around and actually becoming customers because the product experience stopped sucking. Found this pattern in [FounderToolkit](http://foundertoolkit.org/) studying founders who actually scaled past $10K MRR, most said they wasted months on growth tactics before realizing retention was the real problem. Made me realize optimizing funnels only works if people want to stay after they convert. Fix the product experience first, growth hacks second.",

Nobody trusts you\u2026 yet.\n\n# TL;DR\n\n* **Attention**\u00a0*first.*\u00a0**Proof**\u00a0*second.*\u00a0**Free value**\u00a0*last.*\u00a0That\u2019s how the best businesses turn visibility into customers.\n\n# - Hurdle 1\n\n# Nobody Knows You Exist\n\nHalf the battle is just teaching people\u00a0**who you are**\u00a0and\u00a0**what you do.**\n\nThis is why you run ads, make social media content and do cold outreach. It\u2019s surprising how few people even know you exist.\n\nLet me demonstrate. My parents own a local brick and mortar apparel design shop. They\u2019ve been in business\u00a0***over a decade,***\u00a0serving a\u00a0***few thousand***\u00a0customers by now, all while occupying a\u00a0***high traffic building***\u00a0in the middle of town.\n\nWhen it comes up in conversation with locals,\u00a0**not even 10%**\u00a0of the people I talk to know it\u2019s there. That includes people who actively buy apparel for their business, events, sports teams, etc.\n\nI referred my dental hygienist to my parents just the other day. She apparently needed some embroidery for her church group.\n\nLifelong resident of the town. Never knew they were there.\n\nShe\u2019d been using some online company that was more expensive simply because they came up first when she looked up\u00a0*\u201ccustom t-shirts\u201d.*\n\n**Here\u2019s my advice:**\n\n&gt;\"Volume negates luck.\" - Alex Hormozi\n\nThe more you do, the luckier you get. So show more people who you are. More events, more ads, more social media posts.\n\n# - Hurdle 2\n\n# Nobody trusts you\u2026 yet.\n\nNext you have to get new people to trust you. There\u2019s a bunch of ways to do this.\n\nStart with\u00a0**testimonials.**\u00a0Social proof is a free conversion enhancer.\n\nProducts with 5 reviews are\u00a0**270%**\u00a0more likely to be purchased than those with none ([**Spiegel Research Center, Northwestern University**](https://www.scribd.com/document/432903314/How-online-reviews-influence-sales?utm_source=www.thedoitnow.com&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=the-two-hurdles-in-marketing-your-business&amp;_bhlid=0d0603ea77182e1c96f362384350bec62558e40b)). It\u2019s insane.\n\nPeople buy when other people bought and liked it. Add some reviews to your website, post them on social media, and maybe even include them in ad creatives.\n\nAnother method for building trust is by giving away a free product or service. This is what we call a\u00a0***\u201clead magnet\u201d.***\n\nI promise you see them all the time.\n\n* ***Free***\u00a0trials\n* ***Free***\u00a0PDFs\n* ***Free***\u00a0consultations\n* ***Free***\u00a0estimates\n\nBy solving a small problem for someone, you can reveal a larger one and gain their trust in the process.\n\nLet\u2019s say 100 people see an ad you made offering roof replacement. One person may click on it and hire you to replace their roof.\n\nNow let\u2019s reframe that. Instead, your ad now says\u00a0***\u201cfree roofing estimate\u201d.***\u00a0It\u2019s now more likely that 10 people click on it to get the estimate. From there maybe three people hire you. Same audience, same ad spend, different results.\n\nP.S.\n\nWith lead magnets, the worst case is that you now have their contact information to send them offers down the line.\n\nReply with your business\u2019 industry and services and I\u2019ll be happy to get back to you with three personalized lead magnet ideas.",

Never knew they were there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She\u2019d been using some online company that was more expensive simply because they came up first when she looked up\u00a0&lt;em&gt;\u201ccustom t-shirts\u201d.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here\u2019s my advice:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Volume negates luck.&amp;quot; - Alex Hormozi&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The more you do, the luckier you get. So show more people who you are. More events, more ads, more social media posts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;- Hurdle 2&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Nobody trusts you\u2026 yet.&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Next you have to get new people to trust you. There\u2019s a bunch of ways to do this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Start with\u00a0&lt;strong&gt;testimonials.&lt;/strong&gt;\u00a0Social proof is a free conversion enhancer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Products with 5 reviews are\u00a0&lt;strong&gt;270%&lt;/strong&gt;\u00a0more likely to be purchased than those with none (&lt;a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/document/432903314/How-online-reviews-influence-sales?utm_source=www.thedoitnow.com&amp;amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;amp;utm_campaign=the-two-hurdles-in-marketing-your-business&amp;amp;_bhlid=0d0603ea77182e1c96f362384350bec62558e40b\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spiegel Research Center, Northwestern University&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). It\u2019s insane.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;People buy when other people bought and liked it. Add some reviews to your website, post them on social media, and maybe even include them in ad creatives.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another method for building trust is by giving away a free product or service. This is what we call a\u00a0&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;\u201clead magnet\u201d.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I promise you see them all the time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Free&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;\u00a0trials&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Free&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;\u00a0PDFs&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Free&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;\u00a0consultations&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Free&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;\u00a0estimates&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By solving a small problem for someone, you can reveal a larger one and gain their trust in the process.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let\u2019s say 100 people see an ad you made offering roof replacement. One person may click on it and hire you to replace their roof.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now let\u2019s reframe that. Instead, your ad now says\u00a0&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;\u201cfree roofing estimate\u201d.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;\u00a0It\u2019s now more likely that 10 people click on it to get the estimate. From there maybe three people hire you. Same audience, same ad spend, different results.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;P.S.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With lead magnets, the worst case is that you now have their contact information to send them offers down the line.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Reply with your business\u2019 industry and services and I\u2019ll be happy to get back to you with three personalized lead magnet ideas.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
